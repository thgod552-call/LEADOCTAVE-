# Astro + React + Tailwind Starter

This is a minimal starter scaffolded with Astro, React integration, and TailwindCSS.

Getting started (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 3. Build for production
npm run build

# 4. Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

Notes:
- The React components are in `src/components/` and are hydrated with `client:load`.
- Global Tailwind styles are in `src/styles/global.css`.

Replace the placeholder content with your own pages and components.
